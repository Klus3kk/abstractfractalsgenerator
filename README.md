# Abstract Fractals Generator

This repository includes a fractal generator that allows you to create and save SUPER cool fractal images.

## Available Fractals (so far)

* Mandelbrot Set
* Julia Set
* Burning Ship Fractal
* Tricorn Fractal
* Newton Fractal
* Multibrot Set
* Mandelbar Set
* Perpendicular variations of Mandelbrot, Burning Ship, and Buffalo
* Celtic variations of Mandelbrot and Mandelbar

## Features

* Interactive Controls: adjust parameters such as maximum iterations, colormaps, and zoom levels to fine-tune your fractal visualizations.
* Interactive Zoom: double-click on the fractal to dynamically zoom in and explore specific regions of interest.
* Save as Image: export your generated fractals as PNG images.
* Modern UI: the application features a dark theme built with Tkinter and ttkbootstrap for a appealing experience (i mean, who uses light theme anyways?)
